# Porting notes

API mapping decisions made while porting, one section per topic. `docs/PLAN.md` section 6 is the overall mapping; this
file records the concrete choices behind it. Keep it current.

## Registries (#18)

- **One registry class per module package**: `core/CoreRegistry`, `energy/EnergyRegistry`, `factory/FactoryRegistry`,
  `silicon/SiliconRegistry`, `transport/TransportRegistry`, `builders/BuildersRegistry`. Each is the registration half
  of the 4.2.2 module class (`BuildCraftCore`, `BuildCraftEnergy`, ...). Content for a module goes in that module's
  class only; `BuildcraftReforged` calls each class's `register(modBus)` and needs no change when entries are added.
- **`core/ModuleRegisters`** bundles every `DeferredRegister` a module needs, all in the `buildcraftreforged`
  namespace: blocks, items, block entity types, menus, fluids, fluid types, recipe types, recipe serializers, sound
  events, data components, creative tabs. Each registry class owns one instance (`REGISTERS`). NeoForge allows several
  registers for the same registry and namespace, so modules never share a register object. A registry this bundle
  lacks (entity types, attachment types, loot modifiers, ...) is added to `ModuleRegisters` and its `register()`.
- **Field names** are the 4.2.2 static field names (`CoreRegistry.diamondGearItem` for `BuildCraftCore.diamondGearItem`),
  holding a `DeferredItem`/`DeferredBlock`/`DeferredHolder`; call `.get()` where 4.2.2 used the field directly.
- **Registry names** are the 4.2.2 unlocalised names converted from camel case to snake case by
  `RegistryNames.of(...)`: `woodenGearItem` → `wooden_gear_item`, `engineWood` → `engine_wood`,
  `spring.oil` → `spring_oil`. Registry names must be unique across all modules.
- **Translation keys stay the 4.2.2 ones.** Items call `Item.Properties.overrideDescription("item." + unlocalisedName)`
  and blocks `BlockBehaviour.Properties.overrideDescription("tile." + unlocalisedName)`, so
  `item.woodenGearItem` and `tile.engineWood` resolve against the converted `en_us.json`. Metadata variants that 4.2.2
  named with a suffix (`item.pipeGate.0`, `item.redstoneChipset.4`) become separate items or a data component, and
  pick the matching key.
- **Numeric ids and the `Configuration` id section** are gone; `DefaultProps` keeps only the non-id constants.

## Creative tabs (#18)

- `core/CreativeTabBuildCraft` keeps the 4.2.2 enum, `MACHINES` and `FACADES`, registered as
  `buildcraftreforged:machines` and `buildcraftreforged:facades`, titled with the 4.2.2 keys `tab.machines` and
  `tab.facades`. `FACADES` sorts right after `MACHINES`.
- Items join a tab with `CreativeTabBuildCraft.MACHINES.add(holder)` at registration time, in the order they should
  appear. This replaces `setCreativeTab(...)`, which 4.2.2's `ItemBuildCraft` called for every item.
- A tab with no items is hidden by vanilla, so `FACADES` stays invisible until facades exist. Its icon is plain stone
  bricks until `ItemFacade.getStack` is ported.
- The five gears (`BuildCraftCore`'s first items, and the `MACHINES` icon) are registered in `CoreRegistry` as plain
  `Item`s, written from behaviour while #1 is open. They switch to `ItemBuildCraft` with #21.

## Localisation (#18)

- `en_US.properties` is converted to `assets/buildcraftreforged/lang/en_us.json` with all 179 keys unchanged and in the
  original order. `\n` escapes become real line breaks. `%d` became `%s` in `chat.pipe.power.iron.mode`, because
  Minecraft's translation formatter accepts only `%s` and `%n$s`.
- `core/utils/Localization` is not ported: `Component.translatable(key)` replaces `Localization.get(key)` on both
  sides, and `I18n.get(key)` where a client-only string is needed.
- Names 4.2.2 also set in code through `LanguageRegistry.addName` / `CoreProxy.addName` (in every module class) are
  dropped; `en_us.json` is the only source of names. Some differ from the properties text, and the properties text
  is what we keep: "Wood Gear" (code: "Wooden Gear"), "Stirling Engine" (code: "Steam Engine"), "Auto Workbench"
  (code: "Automatic Crafting Table"), "Chute" (code: "Hopper"), "Path Marker" (code: "Path Mark"). Parity review
  (P8) can check which one 1.6.4 actually showed.
